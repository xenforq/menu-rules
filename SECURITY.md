#### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please reach out directly to me via Discord when reporting a security vulnerability, or you can send an email to `hello@xenforq.com`.

We make every effort to respond as soon as possible, although it may take a day or two to sync internally and determine the severity of the report and its impact. Please, do not use a public-facing channel or GitHub issues to report sensitive security issues. 

As part of the process, we will create a security advisory for the affected versions and disclose it publicly, usually two to four weeks after releasing a version that addresses it.
